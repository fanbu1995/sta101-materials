```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## If you want to hide the code chunk but still want the output

You only need to add a "echo=FALSE" argument for the code cell.

The output and plots will be show up but the code itself won't.

```{r example 1, echo=FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```

## If you want to show the code chunk but don't run it

You only need to include a "eval=FALSE" argument. In this way, only the code itself will show up, but it won't run so there will be no output/plots.


```{r example2, eval=FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```
